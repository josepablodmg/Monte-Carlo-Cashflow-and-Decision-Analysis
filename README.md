# 🚀 Monte Carlo Simulation: Cashflow & Decision Analysis

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project demonstrates **advanced Monte Carlo simulations** to analyze **cash flows, costs, and profitability** under uncertainty. Using Python, this work highlights probabilistic modeling, decision analysis, and financial reasoning.

The project simulates thousands of scenarios for:
- **Inflow and outflow of cash** to calculate net cash flow distributions.
- **Variable and fixed costs** to determine their impact on revenue and profit.
- **Profit distributions** for a large population of simulated transactions (n=10,000).

Although this began as an in-class exercise, it is presented here in a **portfolio-ready format** with reproducible code, clear visualizations, and professional documentation.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Model **stochastic inflows and outflows** using realistic probability distributions.
- Calculate **net cash flow** for 10,000 scenarios and analyze distributional properties.
- Simulate **variable and fixed costs**, revenue, and resulting profits across all scenarios.
- Generate **visualizations of distributions** using Seaborn and Python plotting.
- Demonstrate how **sample size and variability** affect financial outcomes and risk assessment.
